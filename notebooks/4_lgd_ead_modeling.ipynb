    "## Lending Club Credit Risk Modeling\n",
    "- In this project, I will build three **machine learning** models to predict the three components of expected loss in the context of **credit risk modeling** at the **Lending Club** (a peer-to-peer credit company): **Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)**. The expected loss will be the product of these elements: **Expected Loss (EL) = PD * EAD * LGD**. These models will be used to stablish a credit policy, deciding wheter to grant a loan or not for new applicants (application model) based on their credit scores and expected losses on loans. By estimating the Expected Loss (EL) from each loan, the Lending Club can also assess the required capital to hold to protect itself against defaults.\n",
    "- The PD modelling encompasses a binary classification problem with target being 1 in case of non-default and 0 in case of default. A Logistic Regression model will be built. \n",
    "- The LGD and EAD modelling encompasses a beta regression problem, that is, a regression task in which the dependent variables are beta distributed, the recovery rate and credit conversion factor, respectively.\n",
    "- The **solution pipeline** is based on the **crisp-dm** framework:\n",

    "## Lending Club\n",
    "- **What is the Lending Club?:**\n",
    "    - LendingClub is a **peer-to-peer lending platform** that facilitates the borrowing and lending of money directly between individuals, without the need for traditional financial institutions such as banks. The platform operates as an online marketplace, connecting borrowers seeking personal loans with investors willing to fund those loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem: Managing Default Risks and Optimizing Returns\n",
    "- **What is the business problem?**\n",
    "    - LendingClub faces a significant business challenge related to **managing default risks effectively** while **optimizing returns** for its investors. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer lending, connecting borrowers with investors, and relies on **accurate risk assessments to maintain a sustainable and profitable lending ecosystem.** Thus, the CEO wants us to provide insights about which factors are associated with credit risk in Lending Club's operations, and to construct models capable of predicting the probability of default for new applicants and possible losses on its loans in order to establish a credit policy, deciding when to grant a loan or not for an applicant. An important observation is that the CEO wants these models to be easy to understand. Since our company works on the internet, making customers happy and being clear is really important. So, we need to be able to explain why we decide to approve or deny a loan.\n",
    "- **Which are the project objectives and benefits?**\n",
    "    1. Identify the factors associated with **credit risk** in the form of business **insights.**\n",
    "    2. Develop an accurate **Probability of Default (PD) Model**, constructing a scorecard. This will allow Lending Club to decide wheter to grant a loan or not to a new applicant (**application model**), based on **credit scores.**\n",
    "    3. Develop **Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) Models**, to estimate the **Expected Loss** in loans. This will allow Lending Club to **hold** sufficient **capital** to protect itself against default in each loan.\n",
    "    4. Improve **risk management** and optimize **returns** by establishing a **credit policy**, trying to balance risk and **ROI** of Lending Club's assets.\n",
    "    5. Apply **model monitoring** and maintenance techniques to safeguard our results from population instability, characterized by significant changes in loan applicants' characteristics. This will allow us to understand whether the built model is still useful in the future or whether the loan applicants characteristics changed significantly, such that we will need to redevelop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credit Risk Modeling Concepts: The Context of the Problem\n",
    "- **Financial institutions**, like LendingClub and online lending platforms, **make money by lending to people and businesses.** When they lend money, they **charge interest**, which is a significant source of their **profits**. **Managing credit risk well is crucial** for these institutions. This means ensuring that borrowers pay back their loans on time to avoid losses.\n",
    "- **Credit risk** is the possibility that a borrower might not fulfill their financial obligations, leading to a loss for the lender. If a borrower fails to meet the agreed-upon terms, it's called a \"default,\" and it can result in financial losses for the lender. The **default** definition is associated with a time horizon. For example, if a borrower hasn't paid their debt within 90 days of the due date, they are considered in default.\n",
    "- In the credit market, important **rules** help keep things honest and clear. **Basel III** is one such set of rules, making sure banks have **enough money (capital requirements)** and follow **guidelines for assessing loan risks**. The **Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB-A)** lets banks figure out credit risks using concepts like Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD). Another rule, **International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9)**, gives standards for measuring financial assets. It's special because it looks at the chance of a loan not being paid back over its entire life, unlike Basel, which checks it for one year. These rules help banks have enough money, handle risks well, and keep the credit market steady and trustworthy.\n",
    "- The **\"expected loss (EL)\"** is the average estimated loss that a lender can expect from loans that default. It involves three factors: the **probability of default (likelihood of a borrower defaulting)**, **loss given default (portion of the amount the bank is exposed to that can't be recovered in case of default)**, and **exposure at default (potential loss at the time of default, considering the outstanding loan amount and other factors)**.\n",
    "- **LendingClub**, operating as a peer-to-peer lending platform, uses a **\"PD Model/Credit Scoring Model\" to assess borrowers' creditworthiness using credit scores**. This helps determine the **likelihood of loan repayment**, guiding the decision to **approve or deny the loan.** The **required capital to guard against default** for each loan is calculated using **EAD and LGD Models** to estimate the **Expected Loss (EL)**, contributing to minimizing risk in credit operations.\n",
    "- When creating a Credit Scoring Model, which assesses creditworthiness for loan approval, using data available at the time of the application is considered an **\"application model.\"** It is distinct from a \"behavior model.\" This is the model I will build here.\n",
    "- A **\"credit policy\"** is a set of guidelines that financial institutions follow to evaluate and manage lending risk. It involves setting a cut-off point, a threshold based on credit scores, or risk categories, to decide whether to approve or reject loan applications. Another factors such as the expected ROI for each loan application are included.\n",
    "- **\"Return on Investment (ROI)\"** is a key measure of loan profitability. Balancing ROI with risk is vital for effective credit policy management. While higher-risk loans may offer more significant potential returns, they also come with a higher chance of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **this notebook**, my goal is to **construct the Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) models**, estimating the **Expected Loss (EL = PD * EAD * LGD)** for each loan, in addition to the PD Model. Once these three components are estimated, I will formulate a **credit policy**, determining loan approval or denial based on these results. These tasks correspond to steps 3, 4, and 5 of the CRISP-DM framework. The rationale behind each decision is detailed below."
